* Attachment Cleaner Module

 When an attachment is deleted in Tryton the stored file in its Binary
 Field is not deleted.

 This happens with all Binary Field that do not store their data in
 database.

 This module aims to record data of files that should be deleted after
 an Attachment is deleted. A bigger goal will be to do it for all
 Binary Fields. This focuses on Attachments.
